A comprehensive open-source implementation and benchmarking study comparing quantum and classical approaches to machine learning algorithms, with special focus on clustering methods and scalability analysis.

## Project Overview

This research project aims to provide **rigorous, reproducible empirical analysis** of quantum machine learning algorithms compared to their classical counterparts. We go beyond theoretical promises to deliver practical insights about when, where, and why quantum ML might offer advantages.

### Key Research Questions
- **Where does quantum advantage actually emerge** in machine learning tasks?
- **How do quantum algorithms scale** with problem size, dataset complexity, and noise?
- **What are the practical crossover points** between quantum and classical performance?
- **How effective are quantum clustering algorithms** compared to classical methods?

### What Makes This Different
- **No hype, just data**: Rigorous statistical analysis with proper error reporting
- **Open science**: All code, data, and results freely available
- **Reproducible**: Every experiment can be replicated and verified
- **Comprehensive**: Covers multiple algorithms, datasets, and metrics
- **Community-driven**: Built for and with the open-source community
